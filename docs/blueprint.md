## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#89B4FA), reflecting reliability and forward-thinking planning. It is bright enough to contrast with a dark background, but not so bold that it feels 'loud'.
- Background color: Dark blue (#29335C), approximately the same hue as the primary color but heavily desaturated and darkened, establishing a modern, serious, but not overwhelming or threatening, tone.
- Accent color: Teal (#469990), which will provide contrast for calls to action and status indicators.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to bring a computerized, techy feel, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain a modern, machined look.
- Use clean, geometric icons to represent each of the city infrastructure and material types, maintaining a balance between aesthetic appeal and ease of recognition.
- A clean, grid-based layout is required to showcase city information.
- Subtle, animated transitions to reflect dynamic simulations and data updates.
